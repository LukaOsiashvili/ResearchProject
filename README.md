The project is divided in two part. First one is for Wear OS platform, second - for Android.

As applications were only tested in emulators, and due to its limitations, some features of apps couldn't be tested or function properly. For this, some parts of code, which requires physical device are commented out, and to see basic functionality simpler implementations are introducted, though commented code is still part of the project and can be used on physical device.
Additionally, there must be some bugs, which were not caught during testing in emulators, and might be seen in physical devices.
